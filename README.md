# Codex Skills

This repository publishes a subset of local Codex skills.

## Published skills

- [`git-worktree-feature-flow`](git-worktree-feature-flow/SKILL.md): Create a feature branch in a Git worktree, work independently, then merge back and clean up safely.
- [`mermaid-github-safe-area`](mermaid-github-safe-area/SKILL.md): Ensure Mermaid diagrams in GitHub READMEs reserve bottom-right safe area using init-only config (no CSS, no spacer nodes) and optionally apply handrawn style on request.
- [`waylog-journal`](waylog-journal/SKILL.md): Summarize `.waylog/history/*.md` into a sanitized per-session cache and a condensed, chronological `.waylog-journal/summary.md` journal. Use WayLog CLI ([`waylog`](https://github.com/shayne-snap/waylog-cli)) to populate `.waylog/history/*.md`.
